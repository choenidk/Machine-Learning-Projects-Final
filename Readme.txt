Due to the size of the project and limited computing power I was forced to divide the project into these three separate notebooks:

Part 1 Sklearn.ipynb:

Project and Domain description, Data visualisation and implementing several Sklearn algorithms

Part 2 Keras.ipynb:
Implementing a Keras Neural Network

Part 3 Dealing with imbalances and Conclusion.ipynb:
Data augmentation and reduction to reduce class imbalance and improve performance. Final conclusion of the project.

All notebooks have also been saved as html files

Other files:
The raw data files are grouped in the folder data_files. 

4 weights files for the models

Capstone project:
The pdf file with the project description


The notebooks can be executed separately.
